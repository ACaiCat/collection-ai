bromwell highs satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled  at  high a classic

a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of its singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level its better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly',\n 'homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if theyll be next to end up on the streetsbr br but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what its like to be homeless? that is goddard bolts lessonbr br mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bets on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cant step off the sidewalk hes given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after its written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets theyre survivors bolt isnt hes not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where its fight or flight kill or be killedbr br while the love connection between molly and bolt wasnt necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what its like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they dont know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly moneybr br or maybe this film will inspire you to help others',\n 'airport  starts as a brand new luxury  plane is loaded up with valuable paintings  such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens james stewart who is flying them  a bunch of vips to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum also on board is stevens daughter julie kathleen quinlan  her son the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid-air the plane is hi-jacked by the co-pilot chambers robert foxworth  his two accomplices banker monte markham  wilson michael pataki who knock the passengers  crew out with sleeping gas they plan to steal the valuable cargo  land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean  loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle with air in short supply water leaking in  having flown over  miles off course the problems mount for the survivors as they await help with time fast running outbr br also known under the slightly different tile airport  this second sequel to the smash-hit disaster thriller airport  was directed by jerry jameson  while once again like its predecessors i cant say airport  is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best just it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking  then the crashing didnt he see the oil rig?  sinking of the  maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure   submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the  floods or if any of the doors are opened  its a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic characters dull dialogue lethargic set-pieces  a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for  odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks  theres not as much urgency as i thought there should have been even when the navy become involved things dont pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships  helicopters flying about but theres just something lacking here george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes  barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the backgroundbr br the home video  theatrical version of airport  run  minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni flashbacks to flesh out characters longer rescue scenes  the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport  as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects arent great either along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie awards hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon thats a little harsh the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properlybr br the production values are alright if nothing spectacular the acting isnt great two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time oscar winner james stewart looks old  frail also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for toobr br airport  is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far  i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production  bland direction doesnt help though  a film about a sunken plane just shouldnt be this boring or lethargic followed by the concorde  airport  ',\n 'brilliant over-acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently im a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often',\n 'this film lacked something i couldnt put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors i just dont knowbr br but could it have been the screenplay? just exactly who was the chef in love with? he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princessbr br i was disappointed in this movie but dont forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself',\n 'this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead',\n 'sorry everyone i know this is supposed to be an art film but wow they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent this story is too painful to watch the absence of a sound track was brutal the loooonnnnng shots were too long how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking? especially when the dialogue is two people complaining i really had a hard time just getting through this film the performances were excellent but how much of that dark sombre uninspired stuff can you take? the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman and im no fan f his either i think anyone who says they enjoyed   hours of this is well lying',\n 'this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic under-rated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but fume and sailor both played their parts well',\n 'when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors it was one of many movies i watched with my parents but this was the only one we walked out of since then i had never seen interiors until just recently and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it what a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of s wine and cheese tripe woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman allen gives us a dark angular muted insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce estrangement career love non-love halitosis whatever the film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is drenched in shadowy pathos this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth but woody allen is no ingmar bergman the film is painfully slow and dull but beyond that i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling whining nicotine stained martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them its never about resolution its only about interminable introspective babble it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audiences ability to connect woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance i highly recommend this one if youre feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death otherwise lets just pretend this film never happened',\n 'this isnt the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirkyinsane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization mixed with robins new love of the thriller but this isnt a thriller per se this is more a mysterysuspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeperbr br also starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until williams character gets close to achieving his goalbr br i must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the storybr br all in all its worth a watch though its definitely not fridaysaturday night farebr br it rates a  frombr br the fiend ',\n 'it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman and lets not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allens bergman pretensions allens whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding what i dont get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ripping off hitchcock in his suspensehorror films? in robin woods view its a strange form of cultural snobbery i would have to agree with that',\n 'yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thrillerbr br the story unfolds in nice volumes while you dont even notice it happeningbr br fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesnt rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is goodbr br very nice  time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story!',\n 'the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than  years to make a swedish film - the first being susan sontags brother carl which was made in sweden with swedish actors no less! the results? oscar wilde said it best in reference to dickens the old curiosity shop one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell pretty much the same thing here interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers im afraid of my anger looking into the middle distance i dont like who im becoming the directorial quotations to use a polite term from bergman are close to parody the incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of strangulation i read a poem of yours the other day it was in - i dont know - the new yorker oh that was an old poem i reworked it far from not caring about these people however i found them quite hilarious much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allens earlier films - only hes directed his actors to play the lines straight having not cast himself in the movie he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics intonations and neurotic habits turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like kenneth branagh in celebritybr br the basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from bergmans winter light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst it all comes through in the shopworn visualaural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach etc etcbr br allens later serious films are less embarrassing but also far less entertaining ill take interiors woodys rarely made a funnier movie',\n 'in this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events gabriel robin williams a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother toni collette when troubling questions arise about this boys story however gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret according to films official synopsisbr br you really should stop reading these comments and watch the film nowbr br the how did he lose his leg? ending with ms collette planning her new life should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes land its overkill the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious by the time mr williams returns to new york possibly her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the highway or video tape scenes the film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a directors cut? br br williams and bobby cannavale as jess dont seem initially believable as a couple a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage otherwise the cast is exemplary williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a gay impersonation sandra oh as anna joe morton as ashe and rory culkin pete logand are all perfectbr br best of all collettes donna belongs in the creepy hall of fame ms oh is correct in saying collette might be you know like that guy from psycho there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly they could have noticed collette with some award consideration she is that good and director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspensefulbr br finally writers stettner armistead maupin and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywherebr br  the night listener  patrick stettner  robin williams toni collette sandra oh rory culkin',\n 'i dont know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars angie charlie denise rosanna and jon that there wasnt enough left to really make a movie this could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a -year-old woman and not angie harmon? why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world? if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead? this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasnt a five year old what a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well',\n 'the night listener   robin williams toni collette bobby cannavale rory culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker dir patrick stettner br br hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand-out low-key performancebr br what is it about celebrities and fans? what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? br br in the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talk-radio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories hes penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no ones editor ashe morton who gives it to no one to read for himself br br no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and petes backgrounds discovering some truths that he didnt anticipatebr br written by armistead maupin who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the films novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fans hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does it helps that williams gives a stand-out low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the corebr br however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for',\n 'this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denises marriage hopefully that effort produces better results',\n 'you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially insomnia and one hour photo the night listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work periodbr br this is a very chilling story even though it doesnt include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mindbr br toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and its this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of  its incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and its scary toobr br this is a good dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end',\n 'the film is bad there is no other way to say it the story is weak and outdated especially for this country i dont think most people know what a walker is or will really care i felt as if i was watching a movie from the s the subject was just not believable for the year  even being set in dc i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end most didnt stay for the qa eitherbr br i dont think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didnt know how to finish them he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on i really didnt get woodys carter private life or boyfriend either what were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures from iraq prisons about? what was he thinking? i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woodys character car it didnt work it didnt even seem to make sense reallybr br the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson he played his character car flawlessly you really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like say twenty years ago he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it br br as for lauren lily and kristin boringbr br dont see it! it is painful! unless you are a true harrelson fan',\n 'when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywoodbr br writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded! br br with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel lifejess and the world around himdonnabr br as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forwardbr br its to bad that most people will avoid this film i only say that because the average american will probably think robin williams in a serious role? that didnt work before! please give this movie a chance! robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of artbr br oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in he has the s leading man looks and screen presence its this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!br br s',\n 'this film is one giant pant load paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process br br the worst though is woody harrelson whom i ordinarily like when hes properly cast he plays the walker a homosexual man in dc who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite he couldnt have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick his southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has it is monotonous but his is not the worst accent in the movie his boyfriend played by moritz bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him he is incapable of rolling his rs in spite of the fact that in real life he is german and speaks several languages - one of them being italian! thats kind of a good reason to cast someone else dont ya think? br br from the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses lily tomlin lauren bacall and kristin scott thomas only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact in fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws if you like these three actresses watch them in something else this movie is not worth your time',\n 'i liked the film some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it a very tense action scene that seemed well donebr br some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles also the film is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too id give the film an  out of ',\n 'the plot for descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events one near the beginning - one at the end together these events make up maybe  of the total movie time everything and i mean everything in between is basically the directors desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i dont get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through  minutes of hazydark literally scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming rosario dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here and no she doesnt get naked not even in the nc- version which i sawbr br if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent take a nap instead - youll probably have more interesting dreams',\n 'there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence that is the premise of the film entitled  the night listner it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon robin williams who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles perhaps its because his show is losing its authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself feeling abandoned by both his lover jess bobby cannavale and his and best friend joe morton he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation it is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a  year old boy called peter rory culkin in reading the boys harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents noon is captivated and wants to help however things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d logand sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop this might be comical instead this may prove to be one of williams more serious performances ',\n 'plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption murder power and the rest of thriller related topics characters are interesting though sometimes not realistic but interesting neverthelessbr br development is slow like tea drinking ceremony visuals not stunning but good enough to ease the eye strain good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much nothing overexciting movie sitcom stylebr br i liked woody - excellent performance had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good the rest are bearable though very predictable the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows',\n 'i enjoyed the night listener very much its one of the better movies of the summerbr br robin williams gives one of his best performances in fact the entire cast was very good all played just the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch toni collette is great as the mom and never goes over the top everyone is very believablebr br its a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the moviebr br the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it wellbr br do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointedbr br my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director

it needed a little more suspense something that makes you jump off your seat the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax i can see how being too suspenseful would have

its merits not the sexual orientation of its director lets go over a quick checklist first  great plot? absolutely i wont give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not

direction at school now for  years of course i really dont think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if you like the direction but i thought i should simply establish once again that im basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevantfor example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team lolbr br patrick stettners direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fast-paced camera-work

dedicated to screening it ok so i may exaggerate on the percentage but you get my drift besides stuff from hollywood bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown im hyped to watch them too tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for  but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas when i watched jodha akbar it was a full house but it wasnt for tashanbr br after watching it i knew why it was entertaining but it was fundamentally weak just like its literal english title which means style tashan is all style but little substance not that it doesnt have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some bordered on a tad ridiculous even for bollywood standards i must say which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya who wrote dhoom and dhoom  both of which i enjoyed tremendously br br in his rookie directorial outing with tashan while you cant fault his direction youd probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best it tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie with hong kongs wirework and hollywoods ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a dhoom  homage was the jetski boat in the middle of nowherebr br at best tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff a call center executive who gives english tuition only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh kareena kapoor whos not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured hottie she engages jimmys services for her boss mobster bhaiyyaji anil kapoor who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it and to complete the quartet akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyajis businessbr br so begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero executing moves that would shame rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee every character has a backstory created and i thought akshay kumars bachchan pandey was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green incredible hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches his wounds also heal automatically which impressively puts wolverine to shame and the best part is his theme song which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversariesbr br but sad to say thats the only tune that is memorable something that cheers bachchan- pandey-bachchan-pandey for most bollywood movies i watch i will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from screenings humming a tune or two i wasnt able to do that after tashan because the songs unfortunately just werent catchy at all usually the songdance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location that i enjoy versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain or atop jagged rocks on the beach frontbr br tashan probably didnt take itself too seriously but coming from vijay krishna acharyas story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well billed as a blockbuster now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one despite akshay kumr stealing the show tashan could have been better on the whole',\n 'after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him -- he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in aro he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and

aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed? the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character the one we are witness of -the moviebr br for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aros mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the

guts off watching this crappy fights it was like akshay against some  thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! phewyou got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences arebr br the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story it reminded me of some of the early s moviesbr br well the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena who looked really hot in this oneand for that i give a rating of  out of br br guys pleasepleasedont see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie well you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenesbr br thats all',\n 'sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this dn ship going to sink??? and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington? he does  half-good movie and wont do a film for less than  million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love-stories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! out of a possible  i give this film a mere ',\n 'the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in  neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman it is hilarious except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film the story looks like the writer told his yr old son to write the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody  is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero',\n 'when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a  star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top br br the acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i dont think anyone could have a better job than kate br br if it is a rainy day and you cant decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much morebr br if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now!!! you wont regret itbr br ',\n 'i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj filmbr br jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss lakhan singh english the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she cant do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh who is also known as bhaiyyaji but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji  lakhan singh is a don in the meantime bhaiyyaji hires a man bachchan pandey to track down jimmy and poojabr br starring saif ali khan kareena kapoor anil kapoor and akshaye kumar the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash choprabr br tashan has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched yes! the scenery is good and kareena kapoor and her much publicised weight loss looks good but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other - hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production with reference to songs unfortunately there is not one song that i can remember nowbr br there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well but this cannot be said for anil kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain lastlynever mind aditya chopra who in the past has produced and directed good films such as mohabbatein what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie? br br conclusion bad movie not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression',\n 'why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather titanic is the greatest movie of the st centurywith great actingdirectingeffectsmusic and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didnt like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies ive ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james camerons masterpiece titanic',\n 'i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom    and saif ali khans son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashbackbr br after watching it i understood that why their wasnt a proper trailer because there wasnt anything in the film to show the story was extremely dum and even a  year old child can come up with a better story-line there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and its difficult to figure out that who is killing who also the action was daft  unrealistic eg  man with a handgun managed to kill about  men with machine gunsbr br while i was watching tashan it reminded me of  filmsbr br sin city during the opening creditsbr br koyla anil kapoors terrible english like amrish puri in koylabr br jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funnybr br i also heard the budget is  crores which is the same amount as dhoom  and i dont know where all the money went to anyway if you did not like dhoom  then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan race was hot on heels and that is a million times betterbr br the only  good songs are dil haara  challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film? even anil kapoors terrible english couldnt save this discomfiture',\n 'just two commentsseven years apart? hardly evidence of the films relentless pulling-power! as has been mentioned the low-budget telemovie status of  gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per sebr br true the plot at its most basic is a re-working of the amityville horror - only without much horror more a case of intrigue! gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key momentsbr br having picked the dvd up for a mere  last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudge the expenditure  would be an acceptable price for the film just dont expect fireworks!',\n 'i dont want to go too far into detail because i cant really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie the animation is crud and the story alternates between boringpointless to extremely irritating the humor was completely lost on the audience and yes - ghost in the shell fans this is not an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy and the humor just did not work after being translated it was a total chore to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything - i wasnt expecting a ghost in the shell sequel but i was expecting something entertaining and it simply didnt achieve this yaaawwnnn rent kinos journey instead',\n 'whats inexplicable? firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got  oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason its a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters ive rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it its a movie yes capital m there its an epic its a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy-handed at timesbr br but the reason titanic works is that its such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isnt exactly dumb but its not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didnt cry when bambis mom died i dont react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and im sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt youll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad? is a single one of them worth a score of  out of ? no not even the phantom menace and this movie made  billion dollars worldwide it cant be bad not possible br br ps how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total  kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasnt anything all that special no one will remember it in  years but im pretty sure titanic will be remembered',\n 'tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the moviebr br this type of movies are actually made for flop what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c-grade movies or even some c-grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan the much hyped and over-confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box-office which it certainly deservedbr br in my view this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films banner how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick? he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvis ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiencesbr br the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saifs hand instead of akshay just from the starting point i expected of it but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth saif is the main behind the whole adventure while akshay joins in the midst in any movie the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit and tashan loses in this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hitbr br akshays has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again in between saif did a great job in race and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie but he has fully developed himself in the acting field and last but not the least about kareena she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean but i myself dont think so instead she became slim yes slim!!! it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say male beside them it is nice that saifs son ibrahim appears in the beginning  last as young saif i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his careerbr br those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood or say want to be admitted in an asylum thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of  years before going into practical directionsbr br sorry i dont like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies',\n 'previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and im a guy in his s i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a  rating by imdbcom usersbr br well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while  of all votes gave it a  rating  gave it a  rating these  of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to  br br in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in  ratings with a high  rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the  rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio believe me ive tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesnt like the movie that much and gave it a  or a  etc everyone has and is entitled to hisher own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only  overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous  ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picturebr br let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to  randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these  will prove my point heavens gate  was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  big top pee-wee  got   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  cat people  got   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  blind date  got   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  jumpin jack flash  got   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  what do all of these films have in common with titanic? all of the percentages of their  ratings are lower !!!! than titanic and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got   ratings! compare that to the other  movies i just mentionedbr br can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor?br br ',\n 'i just saw the movie in theater the movie has very few good points to talk about kareenas beauty and a couple of songs may be thats it the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed even mumbai indians too just now chennai has made it to semi-final br br but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar this is height of stupidity audience is not paying to watch such stupidity i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies they cant make it the last good action i have seen was from ghatak and khiladiyon ka khialdi the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me does these people see their movie after completion? cant they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish? better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it i just want to go back to amitabhs era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes the sound effect was not very effective in those days but visually it is much better than current era scenes br br this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors please dont make any more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic',\n 'i loved this movie since i was  and i saw it on the opening day it was so touching and beautiful i strongly recommend seeing for all its a movie to watch with your family by farbr br my mpaa rating pg- for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nuditysexuality and some language',\n 'the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i dont know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we ? fools!!!! what do they think they will show  men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of   policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of - policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crapbr br i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirementbr br i strongly recommend not to see this movie',\n 'the movie titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so criticised? i have no idea couldwill they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossiblebr br the director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes im not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed! everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting br br the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself titanic is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation the acting was the real effect dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great br br i guess its not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you havent seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood could it get better? no not at all the most moving film of all time dont listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark dont be surprised if you cry too',\n 'i was very displeased with this move everything was terrible from the start the comedy was unhumorous the action overdone the songs unmelodious even the storyline was weightless from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom i had high expectations the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all of course kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done they tend to exaggerate way too much in chinese films this style works because that is their signature piece but hindi cinemas signature are the songs a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic but in the future im sure these action movies will get much sharper also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly good luck next time',\n 'i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i dont think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack and kate winslet is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene hes in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic sank i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the  miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give titanic an  bethany cox',\n 'if there is one film which is the worst of this year- its tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom  style film and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock it was even worst then dhoom  and what i expected first saifs introduction which is boring then saif- kareena meet kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god what he is doing in such a weird film? what kinda role it is? what acting is he doing? his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another jokebr br vijay krishna acharya would have got  films more to direct if this film had worked thats the strategy of yashraj only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music vishal shekhar is ordinarybr br performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay',\n 'i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies anyway everyone remembers the rms titanic it was big fast and unsinkable until april  it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the filmbr br so our two main characters are jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet theyre not annoying too much but watch this and youll find out why they could become annoying  httptinyurlcomojhoyn  the main villain i guess is bad luck fate hand of god no blasphemy intended or just plain caledon hockley billy zane combine all of the above and what do you get?! oh yes! we get a love story on a sinking boat the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite mr andrews victor garberidk he was so nice lovejoydavid warner murdochewan stewart lightoller jonathan phillips captain smithbernard hill molly brownkathy bates and many more we also got the present day treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton they add something to the story something good the action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears the story is simple and it works a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship everything about the story works and there are very few flaws i give titanic an  awesome',\n 'absolutely awful movie utter waste of timebr br background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech well if you really listen closely whatever they speak is actually unintelligiblebr br camera work is bad editing is not present background score gives a headache action is shoddy dialogs are unintelligible acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler now she looks like a starved wrestler hell you can slim down but you cannot gain gracebr br after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure br br please if you want to torture yourself go ahead watch this',\n 'titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship writerdirector james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april   claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good on-screen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch',\n 'sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie i had had a trauma after watching welcome  and thought that they wont do it again but after loads of amazing promos tashan finally ended as heart attackbr br such amazing  songs in promo - dil haara chhaliya and tashan mein and what u get in the movie? zero story predictable plot plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss!!!br br music-wise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these  jokers and they havent thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts! that song is such nice quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album!!! - if you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like bachchan bachchan pandeybr br overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english!br br go away man i need to puke!',\n 'the ship may have sunk but the movie didnt!!! director james cameron from the terminator did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which roses family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the onei hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husbandbr br jack and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but its good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good riskbr br the movie is long but its fantastic!!! good story good flow good actors!!! go see it twice if you want its worth it!!!',\n 'i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent! the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interestbr br saif has over acted kareena has improved her figure but is not a good actress anyway akshay is good anil is also good may i say the role wasnt goodbr br great deal of cheapness is filled in wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish? it has a history of so many good films br br overall i was totally disappointed with the movie',\n 'titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies it has its problems what movies dont but still its enjoyablebr br when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you dont? i know so many people who dont like this movie and im not saying i dont see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isnt it enjoyable and moving? all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesnt actually exist but this is a movie doesnt everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? the next complaint dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials however i think its unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expectedbr br and finally if one is going to complain that they dont like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then im sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things its like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good moviebr br well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best ive ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogybr br i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall its an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epicbr br i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructedbr br i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit itbr br i give this movie  not because i like romance movies but simply because its an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events',\n 'the film lacks style i mean original style everything looks copied including action first appearances in the movie songs dialog delivery etc etc yes there the goof-ups were original like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh  that was one in many goof-ups of the movie  anything good in the movie? yes for kareena fans if there are any kareena in bikini for akshay fans his dialogs and action stunts thats it nothing else so watch it on your own risk and dont blame the director or actors director is already insane and actors i pity them',\n 'titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didnt have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe its just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and lets not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someones imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money ill never let go jack titanic is a great film down to its very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie',\n 'this movie is horrible the acting is a waste basket no crying no action hopeless songs though the scenery is great i have always wanted to go to greecebr br anyway as for saif youd expect a great performance but even he let down the peoplebr br akshay kumar recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs he was sensational in this movie for only this performance filmfare should introduce another award the toiletries award for the worst performance by the way the trophy should be a toilet seatbr br kareena kapoor she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma in acting in looks or in body she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her she comes into this movie wearing bikinis and tank tops and short shorts i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife-to-be dress like that but she mustve impressed some people dressing like that and if you ask how then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom including me personally i think that she dressed like a whore but i really liked itbr br i am forced to give it a  but id really give this movie a  an unachieved film',\n 'another aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well it doesnt resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney  co bring to life it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer highly recommended ',\n 'ok i am not japanese i do know a little about japanese culture and a little less about japanese pop culture other than that i am spanish i eat paella and i like black humorbr br good with that point set i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences mamoru oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and i am surprised he came up with this it may just be one of those lost-in-translation cases i am afraid it is but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible the jokes seemed bad the script was overcooked- i mean give the audience a break and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced speaking and absurd actionbr br however i thought the animation was really cool the idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes however the eye-candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still pictures it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scenebr br i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this the idea was good but horribly exploited maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes but hell if you thought talking head was dense amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a strokebr br of course all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european probably this is totally useless to japanese people maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation maybe',\n 'for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is roses and jacks story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime my heart wont go on from this one',\n

clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of princess diana the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets this was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i dont think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans  of them being teenage girls i was  years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didnt watch the film since i was  a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for  and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype? was it really the best movie of all time? was that leonardos real nose? ok i know thats silly to say but i did re-watch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyagebr br the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank -year-old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in  the upper-class -year-old rose boards the ship with her fianc cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of roses engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt-bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class rose and her mother are financially broke distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance music and beer in third-class but after cals servant informs him of roses whereabouts rose is forbidden from seeing jack again however after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the shipbr br they then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg after overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jacks pocket upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him jack and rose return to the top deck cal and jack though enemies both want rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ships first class staircase jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose downbr br so does titanic live up to its hype? i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a well-written story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of leos baby face or kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film  times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie its a great one and sure to go down in the classics one daybr br ',\n 'the sight of kareena kapoor in a two-piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan  the mega-disappointing mind-numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend bad films are bad films and we see some every week but tashan is not just a bad film its a terrible film terrible because it takes its audience for granted terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because theyve got big movie stars onboardwritten and directed by vijay krishna acharya tashan is what youd describe as a road movie but one thats going in all the wrong directions saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff a call-centre executive whos hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji - thats anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster desperate to go cool jimmys got his eye on pooja the gangsters pretty young assistant played by kareena kapoor who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of  crore rupees determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey the gangsters faithful aide from kanpur who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money thats hidden across the length and breadth of the countrymuch like those bad eighties potboilers tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot but the treatments so over-the-top so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three-act structure you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed that garish item song in the desert the bullet-dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort kareeenas bikini moment even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala and believe it or not even a dhanno-style horse-driven tonga in all fairness not all these set pieces are badly done - the item song in the desert is quite neat actually - but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture because youre just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really little do you expect in a seemingly fast-paced road movie to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweetheartsyou see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making whats more i dont think they cared either - the film reeks of arrogance arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work tashan is like an overcooked stewthere are films that kill you softly and then theres tashan a film that kills you with excess packaged snazzily with glossy-finish camera-work exotic locations and fancy costumes every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesnt hold borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesnt help either because they dont blend with the films wafer-thin plot one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging but anil kapoors grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly unable to find his feet kareena kapoor meanwhile queen of over-the-top delivery does a decent job but of course if tashan is salvaged to some extent its thanks to akshay kumars irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character you cringe when hes cupping his crotch repeatedly and you scowl when he delivers those double-meaning dialogues but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when hes up theredespite some good music from vishal-shekhar the songs seem like theyre only prolonging your misery well thats because tashan is a test of your patience in case you didnt know tashan means style im sorry to say this film has none',\n 'james camerons titanic is essentially

'such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out  out comedya bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors theyve done their part of the movie very well good acting but i dont think that can save the

on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyesbr br the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april   as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the titanics legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april   at  an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until  when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanics many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanicbr br many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanics officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since  where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaires captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husbands side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the post-victorian era of  the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtakingbr br a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matterbr br technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the  years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the filmbr br titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for youbr br ',\n 'this is the biggest flop of  i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster the songs have been added without situations the story have been stretched to fill the  hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors its like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with  people only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish akki is also done a good job but the movieee just forget it']"

      "X_train: ['bromwell high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my  years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell highs satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled  at  high a classic line inspector im here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isnt!', 'story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of its singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level its better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly', 'homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if theyll be next to end up on the streetsbr br but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what its like to be homeless? that is goddard bolts lessonbr br mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bets on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cant step off the sidewalk hes given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after its written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets theyre survivors bolt isnt hes not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where its fight or flight kill or be killedbr br while the love connection between molly and bolt wasnt necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what its like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they dont know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly moneybr br or maybe this film will inspire you to help others', 'airport  starts as a brand new luxury  plane is loaded up with valuable paintings  such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens james stewart who is flying them  a bunch of vips to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the

middle of the bermuda triangle with air in short supply water leaking in  having flown over  miles off course the problems mount for the survivors as they await help with time fast running outbr br also known under the slightly different tile airport  this second sequel to the smash-hit disaster thriller airport  was directed by jerry jameson  while once again like its predecessors i cant say airport  is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best just it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking  then the crashing didnt he see the oil rig?  sinking of the  maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure   submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the  floods or if any of the doors are opened  its a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic characters dull dialogue lethargic set-pieces  a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for  odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks  theres not as much urgency as i thought there should have been even when the navy become involved things dont pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships  helicopters flying about but theres just something lacking here george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes  barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the backgroundbr br the home video  theatrical version of airport  run  minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni flashbacks to flesh out characters longer rescue scenes  the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport  as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects arent great either along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie awards hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon thats a little harsh the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properlybr br the production values are alright if nothing spectacular the acting isnt great two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time oscar winner james stewart looks old  frail also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for toobr br airport  is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far  i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production  bland direction doesnt help though  a film about a sunken plane just shouldnt be this boring or lethargic followed by the concorde  airport  ', 'brilliant over-acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently im a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often', 'this film lacked something i couldnt put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors i just dont knowbr br but could it have been the screenplay? just exactly who was the chef in love with? he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princessbr br i was disappointed in this movie but dont forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself', 'this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead', 'sorry everyone i know this is supposed to be an art film but wow they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent this story is too painful to watch the absence of a sound track was brutal the loooonnnnng shots were too long how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking? especially when the dialogue is two people complaining i really had a hard time just getting through this film the performances were excellent but how much of that dark sombre uninspired stuff can you take? the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman and im no fan f his either i think anyone who says they enjoyed   hours of this is well lying', 'this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic under-rated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but fume and sailor both played their parts well', 'when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors it was one of many movies i watched with my parents but this was the only one we walked out of since then i had never seen interiors until just recently and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it what a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of s wine and cheese tripe woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman allen gives us a dark angular muted insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce estrangement career love non-love halitosis whatever the film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is drenched in shadowy pathos this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth but woody allen is no ingmar bergman the film is painfully slow and dull but beyond that i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling whining nicotine stained martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them its never about resolution its only about interminable introspective babble it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audiences ability to connect woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance i highly recommend this one if youre feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death otherwise lets just pretend this film never happened', 'this isnt the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirkyinsane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization mixed with robins new love of the thriller but this isnt a thriller per se this is more a mysterysuspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeperbr br also starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until williams character gets close to achieving his goalbr br i must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the storybr br all in all its worth a watch though its definitely not fridaysaturday night farebr br it rates a  frombr br the fiend ', 'it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman and lets not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allens bergman pretensions allens whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding what i dont get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ripping off hitchcock in his suspensehorror films? in robin woods view its a strange form of cultural snobbery i would have to agree with that', 'yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thrillerbr br the story unfolds in nice volumes while you dont even notice it happeningbr br fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesnt rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is goodbr br very nice  time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story!', 'the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than  years to make a

into the middle distance i dont like who im becoming the directorial quotations to use a polite term from bergman are close to parody the incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of strangulation i read a poem of yours the other day it was in - i dont know - the new yorker oh that was an old poem i reworked it far from not caring about these people however i found them quite hilarious much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allens earlier films - only hes directed his actors to play the lines straight having not cast himself in the movie he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics intonations and neurotic habits turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like kenneth branagh in celebritybr br the basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from bergmans winter light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst it all comes through in the shopworn visualaural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach etc etcbr br allens later serious films are less embarrassing but also far less entertaining ill take interiors woodys rarely made a funnier movie', 'in this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on

the highway or video tape scenes the film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a directors cut? br br williams and bobby cannavale as jess dont seem initially believable as a couple a scene or

guy from psycho there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly they could have noticed collette with some award consideration she is that good and director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspensefulbr br finally writers stettner armistead maupin and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywherebr br  the night listener  patrick stettner  robin williams toni collette sandra oh rory culkin', 'i dont know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars angie charlie denise rosanna and jon that there wasnt enough left to really make a movie this could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a -year-old woman and not angie harmon? why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world? if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead? this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasnt a five year old what a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well', 'the night listener   robin williams toni collette bobby cannavale rory culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker dir patrick stettner br br

is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in

written by armistead maupin who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the films novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fans hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does it helps that williams gives a stand-out low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the corebr br however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for', 'this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denises marriage hopefully that effort produces better results', 'you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially insomnia and one hour photo the night listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work periodbr br this is a very chilling story even though it doesnt include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mindbr br toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and its this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of  its incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and its scary toobr br this is a good dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end', 'the film is bad there is no other way to say it the story is weak and outdated especially for this country i dont think most people know what a walker is or will really care i felt as if i was watching a movie from the s the subject was just not believable for the year  even being set in dc i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end most didnt stay for the qa eitherbr br i dont think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didnt know how to finish them he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on i really didnt get woodys carter private life or boyfriend either what were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures from iraq prisons about? what was he thinking? i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woodys character car it didnt work it didnt even seem to make sense reallybr br the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson he played his character car flawlessly you really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like say twenty years ago he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it br br as for lauren lily and kristin boringbr br dont see it! it is painful! unless you are a true harrelson fan', 'when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywoodbr br writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded! br br with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel lifejess and the world around himdonnabr br as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event

movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of artbr br oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in he has the s leading man looks and screen presence its this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!br br s', 'this film is one giant pant load paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process br br the worst though is woody harrelson whom i ordinarily like when hes properly cast he plays the walker a homosexual man in dc who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite he couldnt have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick his southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has it is monotonous but his is not the worst accent in the movie his boyfriend played by moritz bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him he is incapable of rolling his rs in spite of the fact that in real life he is german and speaks several languages - one of them being italian! thats kind of a good reason to cast someone else dont ya think? br br from the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses lily tomlin lauren bacall and kristin scott thomas only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact in fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws if you like these three actresses watch them in something else this movie is not worth your time', 'i liked the film some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it a very tense action scene that seemed well donebr br some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles also the film is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too id give the film an  out of ', 'the plot for descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events one near the beginning - one at the end together these events make up maybe  of the total movie time everything and i mean everything in between is basically the directors desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i dont get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through  minutes of hazydark literally scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming rosario dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here and no she doesnt get naked not even in the nc- version which i sawbr br if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent take a nap instead - youll probably have more interesting dreams', 'there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence that is the premise of the film entitled  the night listner it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon robin williams who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles perhaps its because his show is losing its authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself feeling abandoned by both his lover jess bobby cannavale and his and best friend joe morton he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation it is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a  year old boy called peter rory culkin in reading the boys harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents noon is captivated and wants to help however things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare this movie is pure robin williams

over the top everyone is very believablebr br its a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the moviebr br the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it wellbr br do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointedbr br my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audiences imagination but this is a minor quibble', 'this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful mens wivesbr br i thought the walker would be thrilling and engaging but i was so wrong the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow that even after  minutes of the film nothing happens much seriously the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes thats how slow it isbr br the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom its almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class? br br its sad that the walker becomes such a boring mess despite such a strong cast blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing', 'the night listener is probably not one of williams best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before some people maybe wont like the slow pacing of this movie but i think its the great plus of the movie it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year  it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling this is no americanized movie neither is it a predictable movie you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be this is no excellent movie that has everything but hell its a damn good and very original movie', 'this movie must be in line for

this movie and think woody harrison kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movieboy are they in for a horrible timebr br if you like getting ripped off go and rent this

on the way to delivery such a waste because collettes performance was eerie and williams was believable i just kept waiting for it to get better i dont think it was bad editing or needed another director it could have just been the film it came across as a canadian movie something like the first few seasons of x-files not cheap just hokey also it needed a little more suspense something that makes you jump off your seat the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy this movie needs to have a directors cut that tries to fix these problems', 'a worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case  the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut outbr br with such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity no character arcs and inexplicable behaviorbr br the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary -- or on the other

fact that i have never written a review before i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual orientation of its director lets go over a quick checklist first  great plot? absolutely i wont give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials this is a thriller not a horror and it should be

only thing that matters is if you like the direction but i thought i should simply establish once again that im basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevantfor example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team lolbr br patrick stettners direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts were so often subjected to today some people can truly show you a story through their camera

eyeball through which we all seebr br  lighting cinematography and editing? great all around ive already wrote so much and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs so ill

hottest movie of the week given  of the screens dedicated to screening it ok so i may exaggerate on the percentage but you get my drift besides stuff from hollywood bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown im hyped to watch them too tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for  but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas when i watched jodha akbar it was a full house but it wasnt for tashanbr br after watching it i knew why it was entertaining but it was fundamentally weak just like its literal english title which means style tashan is all style but little substance not that it doesnt have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some bordered on a tad ridiculous even for bollywood standards i must say which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya who wrote dhoom and dhoom  both of which i enjoyed tremendously br br in his rookie directorial outing with tashan while you cant fault his direction youd probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best it tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie with hong kongs wirework and hollywoods ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a dhoom  homage was the jetski boat in the middle of nowherebr br at best tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff a call center executive who gives english tuition only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh kareena kapoor whos not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured hottie she engages jimmys services for her boss mobster bhaiyyaji anil kapoor who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it and to complete the quartet akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyajis businessbr br so begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero executing moves that would shame rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee every character has a backstory created and i thought akshay kumars bachchan pandey was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green incredible hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches his wounds also heal automatically which impressively puts wolverine to shame and the best part is his theme song which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversariesbr br but sad to say thats the only tune that is memorable something that cheers bachchan- pandey-bachchan-pandey for most bollywood movies i watch i will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from screenings humming a tune or two i wasnt able to do that after tashan because the songs unfortunately just werent catchy at all usually the songdance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location that i enjoy versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain or atop jagged rocks on the beach frontbr br tashan probably didnt take itself too seriously but coming from vijay krishna acharyas story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well billed as a blockbuster now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one despite akshay kumr stealing the show tashan could have been better on the whole', 'after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him -- he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in aro he follows the same line but really

second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villarongabr br recommended', 'shame on yash raj films and aditya chopra who seems to have lost their

arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character the one we are witness of -the moviebr br for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aros mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done nevertheless the important thing is that the

by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash choprabr br tashan has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched yes! the scenery is good and kareena kapoor and her much publicised weight loss looks good but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other - hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production with reference to songs unfortunately there is not one song that i can remember nowbr br there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well but this cannot be said for anil kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain lastlynever mind aditya chopra who in the past has produced and directed good films such as mohabbatein what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie? br br conclusion bad movie not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression', 'why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather titanic is the greatest movie of the st centurywith great actingdirectingeffectsmusic and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didnt like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies ive ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james camerons masterpiece titanic', 'i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom    and saif ali khans son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashbackbr br after watching it i understood that why their wasnt a proper trailer because there wasnt anything in the film to show the story was extremely dum and even a  year old child can come up with a better story-line there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and its difficult to figure out that who is killing who also the action was daft  unrealistic eg  man with a handgun managed to kill about  men with machine gunsbr br while i was watching tashan it reminded me of  filmsbr br sin city during the opening creditsbr br koyla anil kapoors terrible english like amrish puri in koylabr br jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funnybr br i also heard the budget is  crores which is the same amount as dhoom  and i dont know where all the money went to anyway if you did not like dhoom  then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan race was hot on heels and that is a million times betterbr br the only  good songs are dil haara  challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film? even anil kapoors terrible english couldnt save this discomfiture', 'just two commentsseven years apart? hardly evidence of the films relentless pulling-power! as has been mentioned the low-budget telemovie status of  gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per sebr br true the plot at its most basic is a re-working of the amityville horror - only without much horror more a case of intrigue! gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key momentsbr br having picked the dvd up for a mere  last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudge the expenditure  would be an acceptable price for the film just dont expect fireworks!', 'i dont want to go too far into detail because i cant really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie the animation is crud and the story alternates between boringpointless to extremely irritating the humor was completely lost on the audience and yes - ghost in the shell fans this is not an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy and the humor just did not work after being translated it was a total chore to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything - i wasnt expecting a ghost in the shell sequel but i was expecting something entertaining and it simply didnt achieve this yaaawwnnn rent kinos journey instead', 'whats inexplicable? firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got  oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason its a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters ive rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it its a movie yes capital m there its an epic its a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy-handed at timesbr br but the reason titanic works is that its such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isnt exactly dumb but its not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didnt cry when bambis mom died i dont react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and im sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt youll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad? is a single one of them worth a score of  out of ? no not even the phantom menace and this movie made  billion dollars worldwide it cant be bad not possible br br ps how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total  kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasnt anything all that special no one will remember it in  years but im pretty sure titanic will be remembered', 'tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the moviebr br this type of movies are actually made for flop what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c-grade movies or even some c-grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan the much hyped and over-confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box-office which it certainly deservedbr br in my view this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films banner how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick? he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvis ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiencesbr br the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saifs hand instead of akshay just from the starting point i expected of it but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth saif is the main behind the whole adventure while akshay joins in the midst in any movie the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit and tashan loses in this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hitbr br akshays has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again in between saif did a great job in race and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie but he has fully developed himself in the acting field and last but not the least about kareena she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean but i myself dont think so instead she became slim yes slim!!! it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say male beside them it is nice that saifs son ibrahim appears in the beginning  last as young saif i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his careerbr br those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood or say want to be admitted in an asylum thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of  years before going into practical directionsbr br sorry i dont like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies', 'previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and im a guy in his s i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a  rating by imdbcom usersbr br well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while  of all votes gave it a  rating  gave it a  rating these  of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to  br br in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in  ratings with a high  rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the  rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio believe me ive tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesnt like the movie that much and gave it a  or a  etc everyone has and is entitled to hisher own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only  overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous  ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picturebr br let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to  randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these  will prove my point heavens gate  was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  big top pee-wee  got   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  cat people  got   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  blind date  got   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  jumpin jack flash  got   ratings and   ratings overall rating of  what do all of these films have in common with titanic? all of the percentages of their  ratings are lower !!!! than titanic and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got   ratings! compare that to the other  movies i just mentionedbr br can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor?br br ', 'i just saw the movie in theater the movie has very few good points to talk about kareenas beauty and a couple of songs may be thats it the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed even mumbai indians too just now chennai has made it to semi-final br br but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar this is height of stupidity audience is not paying to watch such stupidity i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies they cant make it the last good action i have seen was from ghatak and khiladiyon ka khialdi the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me does these people see their movie after completion? cant they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish? better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it i just want to go back to amitabhs era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes the sound effect was not very effective in those days but visually it is much better than current era scenes br br this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors please dont make any more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic', 'i loved this movie since i was  and i saw it on the opening day it was so touching and beautiful i strongly recommend seeing for all its a movie to watch with your family by farbr br my mpaa rating pg- for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nuditysexuality and some language', 'the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i dont know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we ? fools!!!! what do they think they will show  men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of   policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of - policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crapbr br i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirementbr br i strongly recommend not to see this movie', 'the movie titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so criticised? i have no idea couldwill they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossiblebr br the director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes im not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed! everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting br br the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself titanic is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation the acting was the real effect dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great br br i guess its not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you havent seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood could it get better? no not at all the most moving film of all time dont listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark dont be surprised if you cry too', 'i was very displeased with this move everything was terrible from the start the comedy was unhumorous the action overdone the songs unmelodious even the storyline was weightless from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom i had high expectations the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all of course kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done they tend to exaggerate way too much in chinese films this style works because that is their signature piece but hindi cinemas signature are the songs a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic but in the future im sure these action movies will get much sharper also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly good luck next time', 'i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i dont think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack and kate winslet is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene hes in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic sank i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the  miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give titanic an  bethany cox', 'if there is one film which is the worst of this year- its tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom  style film and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock it was even worst then dhoom  and what i expected first saifs introduction which is boring then saif- kareena meet kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god what he is doing in such a weird film? what kinda role it is? what acting is he doing? his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another jokebr br vijay krishna acharya would have got  films more to direct if this film had worked thats the strategy of yashraj only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music vishal shekhar is ordinarybr br performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay', 'i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies anyway everyone remembers the rms titanic it was big fast and unsinkable until april  it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the filmbr br so our two main characters are jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet theyre not annoying too much but watch this and youll find out why they could become annoying  httptinyurlcomojhoyn  the main villain i guess is bad luck fate hand of god no blasphemy intended or just plain caledon hockley billy zane combine all of the above and what do you get?! oh yes! we get a love story on a sinking boat the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite mr andrews victor garberidk he was so nice lovejoydavid warner murdochewan stewart lightoller jonathan phillips captain smithbernard hill molly brownkathy bates and many more we also got the present day treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton they add something to the story something good the action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears the story is simple and it works a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship everything about the story works and there are very few flaws i give titanic an  awesome', 'absolutely awful movie utter waste of timebr br background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech well if you really listen closely whatever they speak is actually unintelligiblebr br camera work is bad editing is not present background score gives a headache action is shoddy dialogs are unintelligible acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler now she looks like a starved wrestler hell you can slim down but you cannot gain gracebr br after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure br br please if you want to torture yourself go ahead watch this', 'titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship writerdirector james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april   claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good on-screen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch', 'sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie i had had a trauma after watching welcome  and thought that they wont do it again but after loads of amazing promos tashan finally ended as heart attackbr br such amazing  songs in promo - dil haara chhaliya and tashan mein and what u get in the movie? zero story predictable plot plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss!!!br br music-wise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these  jokers and they havent thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts! that song is such nice quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album!!! - if you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like bachchan bachchan pandeybr br overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english!br br go away man i need to puke!', 'the ship may have sunk but the movie didnt!!! director james cameron from the terminator did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which roses family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the onei hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husbandbr br jack and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but its good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good riskbr br the movie is long but its fantastic!!! good story good flow good actors!!! go see it twice if you want its worth it!!!', 'i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent! the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interestbr br saif has over acted kareena has improved her figure but is not a good actress anyway akshay is good anil is also good may i say the role wasnt goodbr br great deal of cheapness is filled in wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish? it has a history of so many good films br br overall i was totally disappointed with the movie', 'titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies it has its problems what movies dont but still its enjoyablebr br when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you dont? i know so many people who dont like this movie and im not saying i dont see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isnt it enjoyable and moving? all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesnt actually exist but this is a movie doesnt everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? the next complaint dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials however i think its unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expectedbr br and finally if one is going to complain that they dont like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then im sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things its like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good moviebr br well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best ive ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogybr br i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall its an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epicbr br i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructedbr br i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit itbr br i give this movie  not because i like romance movies but simply because its an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events', 'the film lacks style i mean original style everything looks copied including action first appearances in the movie songs dialog delivery etc etc yes there the goof-ups were original like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh  that was one in many goof-ups of the movie  anything good in the movie? yes for kareena fans if there are any kareena in bikini for akshay fans his dialogs and action stunts thats it nothing else so watch it on your own risk and dont blame the director or actors director is already insane and actors i pity them', 'titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didnt have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe its just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and lets not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someones imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money ill never let go jack titanic is a great film down to its very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie', 'this movie is horrible the acting is a waste basket no crying no action hopeless songs though the scenery is great i have always wanted to go to greecebr br anyway as for saif youd expect a great performance but even he let down the peoplebr br akshay kumar recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs he was sensational in this movie for only this performance filmfare should introduce another award the toiletries award for the worst performance by the way the trophy should be a toilet seatbr br kareena kapoor she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma in acting in looks or in body she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her she comes into this movie wearing bikinis and tank tops and short shorts i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife-to-be dress like that but she mustve impressed some people dressing like that and if you ask how then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom including me personally i think that she dressed like a whore but i really liked itbr br i am forced to give it a  but id really give this movie a  an unachieved film', 'another aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well it doesnt resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney  co bring to life it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer highly recommended ', 'ok i am not japanese i do know a little about japanese culture and a little less about japanese pop culture other than that i am spanish i eat paella and i like black humorbr br good with that point set i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences mamoru oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and i am surprised he came up with this it may just be one of those lost-in-translation cases i am afraid it is but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible the jokes seemed bad the script was overcooked- i mean give the audience a break and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced speaking and absurd actionbr br however i thought the animation was really cool the idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes however the eye-candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still pictures it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scenebr br i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this the idea was good but horribly exploited maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes but hell if you thought talking head was dense amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a strokebr br of course all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european probably this is totally useless to japanese people maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation maybe', 'for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is roses and jacks story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a

was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i dont think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans  of them being teenage girls i was  years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didnt watch the film since i was  a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for  and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype? was it really the best movie of all time? was that leonardos real nose? ok i know thats silly to say but i did re-watch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyagebr br the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank -year-old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in  the upper-class -year-old rose boards the ship with her fianc cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of roses engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt-bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class rose and her mother are financially broke distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance music and beer in third-class but after cals servant informs him of roses whereabouts rose is forbidden from seeing jack again however after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the shipbr br they then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg after overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jacks pocket upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him jack and rose return to the top deck cal and jack though enemies both want rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ships first class staircase jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose downbr br so does titanic live up to its hype? i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a well-written story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of leos baby face or kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film  times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie its a great one and sure to go down in the classics one daybr br ', 'the sight of kareena kapoor in a two-piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan  the mega-disappointing mind-numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend bad films are bad films and we see some every week but tashan is not just a bad film its a terrible film terrible because it takes its audience for granted terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because theyve got big movie stars onboardwritten and directed by vijay krishna acharya tashan is what youd describe as a road movie but one thats going in all the wrong directions saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff a call-centre executive whos hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji - thats anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster desperate to go cool jimmys got his eye on pooja the gangsters pretty young assistant played by kareena kapoor who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of  crore rupees determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey the gangsters faithful aide from kanpur who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money thats hidden across the length and breadth of the countrymuch like those bad eighties potboilers tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot but the treatments so over-the-top so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three-act structure you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed that garish item song in the desert the bullet-dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort kareeenas bikini moment even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala and believe it or not even a dhanno-style horse-driven tonga in all fairness not all these set pieces are badly done - the item song in the desert is quite neat actually - but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture because youre just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really little do you expect in a seemingly fast-paced road movie to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweetheartsyou see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making whats more i dont think they cared either - the film reeks of arrogance arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work tashan is like an overcooked stewthere are films that kill you softly and then theres tashan a film that kills you with excess packaged snazzily with glossy-finish camera-work exotic locations and fancy costumes every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesnt hold borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesnt help either because they dont blend with the films wafer-thin plot one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging but anil kapoors grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly unable to find his feet kareena kapoor meanwhile queen of over-the-top delivery does a decent job but of course if tashan is salvaged to some extent its thanks to akshay kumars irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character you cringe when hes cupping his crotch repeatedly and you scowl when he delivers those double-meaning dialogues but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when hes up theredespite some good music from vishal-shekhar the songs seem like theyre only prolonging your misery well thats because tashan is a test of your patience in case you didnt know tashan means style im sorry to say this film has none', 'james camerons titanic is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event its an

it turned out to be a out  out comedya bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors theyve done their part of the movie very well good acting but i dont think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh? were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there -br br action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head  tail of the stunts theyve used akkiakshay

it it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again ive seen it more times than i care to count and i still become transfixed every time with a feeling which is hard to describe one for the ages', 'i would have liked to write about the story but there wasnt any i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but hinglish is only funny for like  minutes after that its overkill i would have liked to swoon over the keep-u-guessing suspense but it was as predictable as um mm a yash raj movie ? i would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action but i dont like cartoons much br br sighbr br all in all this movie is perfect for  people attempting suicide - i promise itll push you over the edge  sado-masochists- this

in a mood to kill someone  movie piraters more power to them if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it barnacles most types of plankton  green algae -

iq of the player tashan promises to lower your iq and that in a mere  hours! woot!br br sighbut thats just me i could be wrong youve been warned anyways', 'titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyesbr br the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april   as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the titanics legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april   at  an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until  when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanics many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanicbr br many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanics officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since  where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaires captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husbands side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the post-victorian era of  the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtakingbr br a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matterbr br technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the  years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the filmbr br titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for youbr br ', 'this is the biggest flop of  i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster the songs have been added without situations the story have been stretched to fill the  hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors its like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with  people only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish akki is also done a good job but the movieee just forget it']\n",
